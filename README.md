# cpp-calculator-app 🚀

Welcome to the **cpp-calculator-app**, a powerful and easy-to-use scientific calculator written in C++. This app provides both basic and advanced mathematical operations in a simple console interface.

## Features ✨
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) 🧮
- Advanced mathematical functions:
  - Square root (√) 🌟
  - Exponentiation (^) 📈
  - Trigonometric functions: sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan) with degree input 🎯
  - Logarithmic functions: base 10 (log), natural log (ln) 📊
- Interactive mode for continuous calculations 🔄
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero, negative square roots) ⚠️

## Usage 🖥️
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o calculator`)
2. Run the resulting executable (`./calculator` on Unix/Linux/Mac or `calculator.exe` on Windows)
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter operations and numbers

## Example Usage 💡
```
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^, s for sqrt, c for cos, t for tan, i for sin, l for log, n for ln): s
Enter number: 16
Result: 4

Enter operation (+, -, *, /, ^, s for sqrt, c for cos, t for tan, i for sin, l for log, n for ln): c
Enter angle in degrees: 90
Result: 0
